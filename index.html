# Welcome to pwn.college!
pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “[white belt](https://pwn.college/fundamentals/)” in cybersecurity to becoming a “[blue belt](https://pwn.college/cse494-s2023/)”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.

pwn.college was created by [Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)](http://yancomm.net) and [kanak (Connor Nelson)](https://connornelson.com) at Arizona State University. It powers ASU’s Introduction to Cybersecurity (CSE 365) and Computer Systems Security (CSE 466) courses, and is open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!

# Great! How do I jump in?
pwn.college is organized into a series of modules, that launch throughout the school year and stay open until the next iteration of the courses. For each module, students should go through the following process:

1. Watch the **PRERECORDED MODULE LECTURES** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/pwncollege). These classes represent the bulk of the passive educational content in pwn.college! They give you a starting point from which to approach the practice problems (Step 3, below).</li>

2.	Attend the LIVE CLASSES on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege), during the ASU semester.

3.	Catch up on any live classes you miss by checking out RECORDED STREAMS, which are [initially saved on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege/videos) right after the live stream (but time out after a week or two) and are eventually [archived to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/pwncollege). The live classes are used to fill in gaps between prerecorded lectures and answer student questions. Current live classes:
<ul>
  <li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ymxv0nOtqqYpFVmqh9Wsfebq05pssju>CSE365 Spring 2024</a></li>
  <li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ymxv0nOtqr7zM7ZBREoWa-eeSaKFJQd>CSE598 Spring 2024</a></li>
</ul>

4.	Solve the **CHALLENGE PROBLEMS** hosted in the [dojos](https://pwn.college/dojos). The challenge problems are the active educational component of pwn.college. They are absolutely critical to learning: the lectures give you a starting point for the content, but the challenge problems force you to truly learn it.

5.	When you run into problems with the challenges, you can GET HELP on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/e4UU4ytK6q). The discord is also a great place to chat with other aspiring hackers!

pwn.college currently has four major stages of progression. Consider hacking as a martial art that students earn belts in as they progress. We currently have four belts in four dedicated dojos: [orange](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/), [yellow](https://pwn.college/program-security/), [green](https://pwn.college/system-security/), and [blue](https://pwn.college/software-exploitation/).

Over time, hackers become more sure in their skills, achieving *brown belt* status (and able to, for example, usefully contribute to the cybersecurity industry), before finally graduating to hacking masters: *black belts*. But this, unfortunately, must happen outside of the dojo (for now!).

<br><br>

# Launching Challenges
At the core of pwn.college is flags. How do you get those flags? Solve challenges. You can start a challenge by clicking on the `Challenges` tab at the top, selecting a module, clicking on a particular level, and hitting `Start`. In order to access that challenge, you have two options.

The first option is using the `Workspace` tab. This will present you with a fully functional development environment in your browser via Visual Studio Code. You can, for instance, quickly open a new terminal by pressing `F1`, searching for `New Terminal`, and pressing enter.

The second option is using `ssh`. In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to `Settings` > `SSH Key`. You can quickly generate an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''` in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine. This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your private and public keys respectively. Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can run `ssh -i key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` to connect into your challenge instance.

Once you are in a challenge instance, your goal is to get the contents of the `/flag` file. Unfortunately for you, you are executing as the `hacker` user, but `/flag` is only readable by the `root` user. Fortunately, however, there are challenge programs located inside of the `/challenge` directory, which when run, will run with the privileges of the `root` user. Solve the challenge to get the `/flag`, and then submit it in order to complete the challenge!

A few things to note. Your home directory `/home/hacker` is persistent. This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there. The `Practice` button can be incredibly useful for debugging your solution. When you start a challenge in this way, you will have the ability to run programs as the `root` user with the `sudo` command; however, the instance will only have a practice flag. For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine. You can interact with the virtual machine using the `vm` command.

# The Belts
This course progresses hackers from white belts, to orange belts, yellow belts, green belts, and then finally refines them into blue belts. This is not just metaphor: **we have actual belts, in yellow, green, and blue, custom-embroidered for pwn.college.**

### How to earn an orange belt?
For an orange belt, you must complete all active challenges launched in:
- [Intro to Cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/)

### How to earn a yellow belt?
For a yellow belt, you must complete all active challenges launched in:
- [Intro to Cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/)
- [Program Security](https://pwn.college/program-security/)

### How to earn a green belt?
For a green belt, you must complete all active challenges launched in:
- [Intro to Cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/)
- [Program Security](https://pwn.college/program-security/)
- [System Security](https://pwn.college/system-security/)

### How to earn a blue belt?
For a blue belt, you must complete all active challenges launched in:
- [Intro to Cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/)
- [Program Security](https://pwn.college/program-security/)
- [System Security](https://pwn.college/system-security/)
- [Software Exploitation](https://pwn.college/software-exploitation/)

### How to get the actual belt?
To get your belt,  [send us an email](malto:pwn@pwn.college) from the email address associated with your pwn.college account once you’ve completed the necessary challenges. We’ll then get your belt over to you (eventually)!

**Who has earned belts?** We maintain a [list of hackers with pwn.college belts](https://static.pwn.college/belts). Once you achieve your belt, if you provide your name, email address, and emoji, we will add you to the [list](https://static.pwn.college/belts)!

# Collaboration, Livestream, and Writeup Policy
The challenges created for pwn.college are educational material, and are used to grade students at ASU. Because of this, we would appreciate that writeups, walkthrough videos, and livestreams of challenge solutions are not posted to the internet. Obviously, we can’t enforce this, but we worked hard to make all of this public, and we would appreciate your help in keeping pwn.college a viable educational platform.

<br><br>

# Further Practice
After you learn the basics of cybersecurity and earn your blue belt, you should move on to harder challenges.

Capture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way. The most popular way to find upcoming events is at [https://ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org). There is also a list of introductory CTFs [here](https://zaratec.io/ctf-practice/). If you are at ASU, feel free to check out and join ASU’s enigmatic [hacking club](http://asuhacking.club).

Wargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills. Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based. You can find a list of wargames at [https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus](https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus).

If you want to get involved with cybersecurity research, but don’t know how, consider joining us for an [internship at ASU](https://sefcom.asu.edu/apprenticeship).
